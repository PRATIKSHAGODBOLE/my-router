      React Router is a popular library for implementing routing in React applications. It provides a set of components and utilities that enable declarative routing and navigation within a React application. React Router allows you to create a single-page application with multiple views or pages, making it easier to manage and navigate between different parts of your application.
      React Router is widely used in React applications to handle client-side routing and navigation. It helps developers build scalable and maintainable applications by organizing different views or pages into separate components and handling their rendering based on the current URL or route.
